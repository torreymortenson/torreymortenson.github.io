  <p>The motivation behind exploiting simulation experiments is that while a user study is useful and important to understand whether a recommendation model is effective and well-accepted by users, the study itself is yet adequate to fully assess the model performance in numerous potential group situations, given the dynamics of group decision making process.</p>

<p>Our first proposed simulation model of a group discussion has been used to study the impact of alternative combinations of long-term and session-based preferences on the recommendation performance in different group scenarios.</p>

<p>The second simulation analysis has been designed to further investigates the effect of an individual&rsquo;s conflict resolution style on a group decision making outcome supported by a recommendation process.</p>
